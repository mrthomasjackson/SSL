Week One Screencast* Present form processing application in browser.o Demonstrate form with the correct image file type and without correct file type* Index.html / HTML Formo Simple design using bootstrap CSS frameworko Form action POSTÕs to newUser.php* newUser.php / PHP form processing scripto function ÒreadFormData()Ó reads the data from the HTML input fields and stores them in an associative array. The array is returned as the function is run.o function ÒuploadAvatar()Ó reads the file uploaded in the HTML form and determines if it is a JPEG or PNG file type. If the file type is correct, it stores the file in the images directory and returns the relative path to the image.* If the file type is incorrect, the function will return the relative path to a default image file as an error.o The HTML markup lists the information submitted by the user.* Using a for each loop, each item in the registration array is sent to the browser as  part of  a HTML unordered list group.* The uploadAvatar function is called to return the relative path of the image that will be shown.* I found the PHP file upload article from W3C to be a useful resource for learning more about uploading files in PHP.o In addition to limiting the file by type, it can also be limited by file size.
